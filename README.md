# norman 

Special-purpose software for Warwick Statistics internal reports on module marks

This is open source software, but unlikely to be of interest to anyone not involved in the administration of the Department of Statistics at the University of Warwick.

> [!NOTE]
> The original version of norman was developed by David Firth. With his retirement, and on his suggestion, the Warwick-Stats-Resources organisation has forked his repository and all further development of the package will happen here.

## Instructions

**norman** is an _R_ package, and there is a short document (a _vignette_ in _R_) that gives instructions on how to install it and use it.  The vignette can either be viewed in _R_ (once the package has been installed!) by running `browseVignettes("norman")`, or directly on the web at 
https://warwick-stats-resources.github.io/norman/articles/norman.html

## Why "norman"?

Because David needed a memorable name for this package.  And because _nobody_ was ever better at marking: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Hunter_(footballer)
