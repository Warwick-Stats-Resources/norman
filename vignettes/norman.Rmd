Here are instructions for using the **norman** package, to generate a report (in PDF) on any given set of exam marks.

This is **all** specific to the administration of courses in the Department of Statistics at the University of Warwick.  It is of no conceivable interest to anyone else. 

I recommend reading the whole document before doing anything --- to get the idea of how all this is meant to work.

# 0. Setup your _RStudio_ and _LaTeX_ (if not done already)

The instructions below (from step 1 onwards) will all assume that you have a functioning installation of _R_, _Rtools_, _RStudio_ and _LaTeX_ --- specifically, a setup that is capable of "knitting" an _R Markdown_ (`.Rmd`) file to a PDF output document. (A part of that setup with be the installation of the _R_ add-on package **rmarkdown**.)

These installations are all fairly standard. Our IT support staff should be able to handle it without problem.

It's probably best to test your setup on a relatively _simple_
R Markdown document, such as the one you get when selecting **File --> New file --> R markdown** in
Rstudio's menu.  With such a file open in the _RStudio_ editor, try doing **Knit to PDF** (from the "Knit" menu).

In Windows, setting up these things seems sometimes to be problematic, I don't know why.  But there are plenty of tips available online (e.g., https://rickpackblog.wordpress.com/2017/10/04/miktex-install-for-r-windows-pdf-output-r-markdown/ ).  Good luck with it!  Thankfully you'll only need to do it once --- until you get a new computer, of course.

# 0.5. Add the **norman** package to your _R_ installation 

## 0.5.1 Installing **norman**

The package **norman** builds Warwick Statistics reports on exam marks. 

To install **norman** for the first time: in your _R_ Console (which is one of the panes in the _RStudio_ window), paste the following and hit return:
```
if (!("remotes" %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("Warwick-Stats-Resources/norman", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

The installation of **norman** should also trigger the installation of five other 
packages if you do not have them already.  They are **aplpack**, **ggplot2**, **dplyr**, **readr**, and **scales**.

## 0.5.2 Installing **rmarkdown** (if you have not done it already in step 0)

Again in your _R_ console:

```
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```

## 0.5.9 _Updating_ **norman**

This will be needed only later, whenever the **norman** package itself has been 
updated to a new version --- for example, after **norman** has been improved 
to fix bugs or to add new features to 
the reports it makes. 
If you have only just installed **norman** (as detailed above), 
you should _skip this section for now but keep it in mind for when needed._

Whenever you _do_ find the need to update **norman**, 
in your _R_ console just
issue the following command:
```
norman::update()
```

# 1.  Make a separate folder for each report that you will prepare (if not made already)

In 2019 for example, you might want to have folders named something like

- _2019_Second_Year_marks_before_scaling_
- _2019_Second_Year_marks_after_scaling_
- _2019_Finals_and_MSc_marks_before_scaling_
- _2019_Finals_and_MSc_marks_after_scaling_

--- but the names can be chosen freely, depending on your specific filing needs.  The name of each folder should indicate clearly _which marks_ will be used in making the corresponding report.

You can have as many of these folders as you want --- it just needs to be _one folder 
for each report that you want to make_.  Each folder will be a separate "project" (in the terminology of _RStudio_).

# 2.  Decide which report you want to make first (or next)

This determines _which_ of the folders you made will be the one that you will be working in next.  That folder will be called **your current working folder** in what follows (and the report that you want to make in that folder will be called **your current report**).

# 3.  The data requirements for making one report

## All reports

Your working folder must contain **the following five things**.  (Other things can be there too, for example your own notes or whatever; but the software won't work properly without the 3 things listed below.)

### 3a. A subfolder containing the mark sheets

The most essential input to this report-building package is a subfolder containing exam marks.

The subfolder should be named simply as `marks`.  If you give it any other name, the software will not work.  (This is deliberate.)

The folder can contain any number of comma-separated-values (`.csv`) files.  Each such file must have a name that starts with the 5-character code for a module, for example `ST344_raw_marks_2019.csv`.
The rest of each file name (after the first 5 characters, before `.csv`) can be anything, within reason.

Each of the `.csv` files must contain _at least_ columns named `sprCode` and `overallMark` --- these
being the columns that identify students, and give each student's mark in the module.  Any other columns present in the `.csv` files will simply be ignored.

### 3b. A sheet of module names

This must be a comma-separated-values file named `module_names.csv` file with 2 columns, headed `ModuleCode` and `ModuleName`.  

This file _must_ provide a module name for (at least) each module code that will be found in the `marks` folder for the current report.  (Different `module_names.csv` files can be used in different reports, if needed.)  

(The `module_names.csv` file _can_ safely contain also module codes/names that are not relevant to your current report --- they will simply be ignored.) 

### 3c. A list of the modules that are expected to be found in the marks folder for this report

This must be a simple, plain text file named `modules_expected_here.txt` (a file made, for example, with _Notepad+_).  It should contain one 5-character module code on each line.  

The modules listed in this file should be all the ones that are relevant to your current report.

This file is used only for _checking_ purposes, to provide a warning if either

- the marks folder contains some modules that were not expected
- some modules that _were_ expected are missing from the marks folder.

## For reports where students are grouped in the scatter plots (e.g.. final year reports)

If a grouping is desired for the scatter plots on the module pages, the following **two files** must **both** be in the working folder.

### 3d. A file linking each student with their course 

This must be a file named `student_course.csv`, with two columns, `ID` and `Course`.

`ID` is the 7-digit student ID number. `Course` is their course code, e.g. "USTA-G302".

### 3e. A file linking course codes with the groupings for the scatter plots

This must be a file named `course_mappings.csv`, with two columns, `Course` and `Group`.

`Course` is a course code, e.g. "USTA-G302". There should be one course code for each (unique) `Course` in `student_course.csv`. `Group` is whatever grouping is needed for the scatter plots of module marks against the median of ST modules taken, as it appears on each individual module page of the report. This will likely be degree types, e.g. "BSc", "IM".

## For saving history

If you wish to save the marks summaries and module effects with the [save_history()] function, the working folder *must* contain a file with the year and *may* already contain the history.
Note that neither of these files are needed to knit the report.

### 3f. A file with the year

This must be called `year.txt` and contain exactly one line of text, with the 4-digit year of exam marks in the `marks` folder, e.g. 2025.

### 3g. A file with the marks history

This file must be called `history.csv`.

If there is no file called `history.csv` in the working folder, a `history.csv` file will be created the first time you call `save_history()`, with the 8-number summary and module effects for the year in `year.txt`.
If you call `save_history()` again in the same year, you will have the option to either overwrite the currently saved data or not.

This `history.csv` file should be copied into the RStudio projects for future years. 
Then, when `save_history()` is called in that year, the data will be appended.

No data will be deleted from `history.csv`, but only the most recent five years will be shown on the history pages of the report.

# 4.  Start up RStudio and make a new RStudio project (if not made already)

From the **File** menu in _RStudio_, pick **New Project** and then **Existing Directory**.  Then browse to your current working folder and click **Create Project**.

# 5.  Make a new R Markdown document for your current report

Still in _RStudio_: **File -> New File -> R Markdown -> From Template**, then from the menu pick the item **Warwick Stats report on module marks**.

This will open up a template `.Rmd` file for editing.

In that template there are 3 places labelled **????** where you will want to make appropriate edits.  (The edits can be done at a later time, if you want to see your report first.)  These edits will provide:

- the **title** of your report
- the **author** of the report (i.e., who it was prepared by)
- any **remarks** that you might want to appear at the top of the report (for example, about the report's status, about any data that's missing, or whatever else you might want to note there).

When you have finished editing those 3 things, or if you have decided to postpone that editing until later, pick **File -> Save as...** and save your `.Rmd` file
into your current working folder, with a name that will clearly identify your report.  (For example, 
`2019_Second_year_marks_report_before_scaling.Rmd` --- or whatever you want, but it must have the file extension `.Rmd`.)

# 6.  Make the report

Just click on **Knit** at the top of your _RStudio_ window.

If all goes well, this will make your report as a PDF document in your current working folder (with the same name as your `.Rmd` file, but with the `.pdf` extension replacing `.Rmd`).

# 7.  Re-making a report after some of the data has changed, or after you have made edits

When the data has changed (for whatever reason), or when you want to make fresh edits to the title, author or remarks fields of the report, you can update your report just by opening the `.Rmd` file (in _RStudio_).  Make any necessary edits and then click
**Knit** to save the report and re-make the PDF document.

Note that this will **over-write** your previous report.  So if you want to keep the previous PDF, you should re-name it first, before updating the report as described above.

# 8. Save the module summaries and effects

Check there is a `year.txt` file in the working folder (see point 3f above) and (optionally) a `history.csv` file (see point 3g).

In the RStudio console, run:

```
norman::save_history()
```

# 9.  Problems?

Ask Jon Forster, Ella Kaye or David Firth for advice (in that order!), if any of the above is unclear or does not work.
