# norman

Special-purpose software for Warwick Statistics internal reports on
module marks

This is open source software, but unlikely to be of interest to anyone
not involved in the administration of the Department of Statistics at
the University of Warwick.

> \[!NOTE\] The original version of norman was developed by David Firth.
> With his retirement, and on his suggestion, the
> Warwick-Stats-Resources organisation has forked his repository and all
> further development of the package will happen here.

## Instructions

**norman** is an *R* package, and there is a short document (a
*vignette* in *R*) that gives instructions on how to install it and use
it. The vignette can either be viewed in *R* (once the package has been
installed!) by running `browseVignettes("norman")`, or directly on the
web at
<https://warwick-stats-resources.github.io/norman/articles/norman.html>

## Why “norman”?

Because David needed a memorable name for this package. And because
*nobody* was ever better at marking:
